# Welcome to My GitHub!


Hi, I'm **Syed Uzair Gillani**, an enthusiastic Electrical Engineer currently exploring the dynamic domain of engineering and technology.

## What I Do

As an Electrical Engineer with a strong focus on the intersection of hardware and software, I specialize in electronic circuit design, signal processing, and embedded systems. My work involves hands-on projects that demonstrate practical applications in these areas. I am proficient in programming languages like C, C++, Python, and Assembly, and I enjoy developing algorithms and software solutions.

Additionally, I excel in project management, ensuring successful project execution from start to finish. I am also exploring AI and computer vision, expanding my expertise into these cutting-edge fields. My commitment to partnerships and collaborations drives innovation and fosters growth within the tech community.

## Current Work
My GitHub repositories highlight a diverse range of projects, from beginner to advanced, developed individually and in groups during my time at university. I've recently delved into GNU Radio, gaining insights into modulation systems for transmission and reception, and expanded my knowledge of communication networks through Cisco networking.
My projects span across various domains, including FOSSSC (Free, Open-Source Software Stack Cluster for Digital System Design), a Smart Home Automation System, an IoT Weather Station, a Signal Processing Toolbox, and a Python-based Library Management System. My programming experience includes languages like C++, C, Python, and Verilog, with a strong focus on practical, real-world applications.
